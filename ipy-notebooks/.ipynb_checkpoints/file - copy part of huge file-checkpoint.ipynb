      "How do I do this? Obviously 12GB won't fit into memory, that's fine, but 8GB won't either... Which I thought was fine, but it appears binary doesn't seem to like it if you do it in chunks! I was appending 10MB at a time to a new binary file and there are discontinuities on the edges of each 10MB chunk in the new file."
